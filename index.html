                    <b>Padingo</b> is a web-based digital assistant that will help you find answers to your questions.
                    Made and published by <a href="github.com/berakpaijo/" target="_blank"><b>LordPaijo</b></a> and <a href="github.com/Rifky1720" target="_blank"><b>Rifky1720</b></a> at home, on the <br><b>16th of November 2024.</b> 
                    It uses the <b>WebKit-SpeechRecognition</b> API on JavaScript and was made using Javascript.
                    It's <b>free</b> and <b>open-source</b> and can be obtained from this
                    <a href="https://github.com/berakpaijo/Padingo-WebAssistant/" target="_blank"><b>GitHub repository</b></a>.

                <h2>How to use</h2>
                <p>
                    Make sure your browser supports <b>Webkit-SpeechRecognition</b> API <b>PERFECTLY</b>. This will ensure that features such as <b>voice recognition</b> won't have issues.
                    Otherwise, you will have a <b>bad experience</b>, or worse, it will <b>stop working</b>. After you're sure of everything, you can now use it by <b>simply clicking the speak button</b>.
                    Say anything... It'll google it for you...

                    <b>Sharing is caring</b>, with this philosophy we can make something that everyone can use and also recreate it and make a version of themself. 
                    We made this project <b>free</b> and <b>open-source</b> so anyone can use the code from the <b>source code</b> that is open in the <b>GitHub repository</b>.
                    I've made full <b>documentation</b> about it, which you can check at

            <h2>About the Developers</h2>
            <p>
                <br>
                Two idiots made this project. One's a computer geek, one's a literal idiot living who lives life as it is. Here, you will be told about the two.
                <br><br>
                <b>LordPaijo</b>, real name: <b>M Zayyan Maulana</b>. The idiotic computer geek who did nothing but his hobbies. 
                He did almost everything here except for the backend (yes, he's the fullstack guy who's just lazy and doesn't want to touch JavaScript at all costs. 
                And yes, he wrote this article). He worked on the frontend, that's why you're seeing the word "LordPaijo" everywhere. He's bald... of course, and he's proud about it.
                He's very misplaced to be here because it's not his domain as a web developer, he's more interested in low-level engineering. And he hates it...
                You can find him on his <a href="github.com/berakpaijo/" target="_blank"><b>Github Page</b></a>, <a href="instagram.com/berakpaijo/" target="_blank"><b>Instagram Account</b></a>, 
                <a href="reddit.com/user/LordPaijo" target="_blank"><b>Reddit User</b></a>, <a href="threads.net/@berakpaijo" target="_blank"><b>Threads Account</b>,</a> 
                and his <a href="youtube.com/@LordPaijo" target="_blank"><b>Youtube Channel</b>.</a>
                <br><br>
                <b>Rifky1720</b>, real name: <b>M Rifky Putra Cahyadi</b>. The <b>literal</b> idiot living thing that has no care in the world of what he sees and does. 
                He's just... there... existing for no reason yet had a heart of rocky alley washed by a strain of waterfalls. All he did in life was do what the wind told him. 
                No less, no more. You told him to do something, he will do that thing... well, maybe not all but sometimes... yeah you get the idea. 
                Anyway, he's working on the backend here. And he's good at it I guess? I mean he looks like that web development tutor on YouTube. 
                Go check him out on <a href="https://github.com/Rifky1720" target="_blank"><b>Github</b></a>,<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@dikasih_info_maszeh?_t=8rUyw3CNqwG&_r=1" target="_blank"><b>TikTok</b></a>, and <a href="instagram.com/minyaktelonmaxx"><b>Instagram</b></a>
